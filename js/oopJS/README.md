## Object Destructuring

Object destructuring allows you to extract specific properties from objects and assign them to variables.

You can also set default values during destructuring.

Use the rest operator to collect remaining properties into a new object.

## Object Spread Operator

The object spread operator (`...`) creates a new object by combining properties from multiple objects.

## Function Parameter Destructuring

You can destructure object properties directly within function parameters.

## Inheritance and Composition

Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. Composition involves creating objects with functions to achieve flexibility.
